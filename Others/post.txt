🎉 Just completed the Cloud Resume Challenge!

After earning my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I built a complete serverless resume website to put my skills into practice.

🏗️ What I built:
✅ Responsive website with real-time visitor counter
✅ Serverless backend (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)
✅ Global CDN with custom domain & SSL
✅ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
✅ Full CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
✅ Mobile-friendly design

📊 Results:
• Load time: < 2 seconds globally
• Cost: < $2/month
• 99.9% uptime

This project taught me so much about real-world cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and serverless computing. Ready to take on cloud engineering challenges!
